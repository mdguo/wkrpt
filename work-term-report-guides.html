			<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
				<p>This document describes the Electrical and Computer Engineering Departmental Policy and Grading Information for the evaluation of Work Term Reports submitted for credit by Electrical Engineering students and Computer Engineering Students.</p>
				<p>The Co-Operative Education and Career Services Department produces a booklet [<a href="#coop">1</a>] which describes various co-op related regulations. It includes a chapter on work term report guidelines, an appendix on regulations and a supplement for the Faculty of Engineering specific rules. This document is intended to augment that material with various departmental regulations and guidelines.</p>
				<p>The goal of a work term report is to assist the student in developing his/her technical communication skills. With that goal in mind, the work term report is to be judged on both matters and communication skills. Each report must obtain a passing grade in each component. The sections below describe these two components.</p>

			<h3 id = "topic">1.1 Report Topic</h3>
				<p>When selecting a work term report topic, write the <em>purpose and scope</em> sentence/paragraph for your report's Introduction and Summary sections. If it implies a set of conclusions which imply a set of recommendations, that will communicate the expected/required level of engineering analysis, insight, and judgement, then the report topic should work well.  In most cases, you want to approach the report as if you are a consulting engineer who has been retained by a client to investigate some issue/problem and supply a set of engineering recommendations to resolve that issue/problem for the client.</p>
				<p>It is important when selecting a work term report topic to keep in mind the report will be marked based on which academic terms you have completed. As you progress through the program the technical content and technical communication expectation increase. In your first report, qualitative analysis may be acceptable. By your third report, quantitative analysis is required.  In addition, the report topic must be within E&CE topics.</p>

			<h3 id = "confidential">1.2 Confidential and Self-study Work Reports</h3>
				<p>All students are expected to submit work term reports which describe a technical topic related to their work on a work term. This report should not be a company document, with some added sections to turn it into an acceptable work report.  It should be a report, written specifically to satisfy the requirements of the work term report component of the B.A.Sc. degree.  Whenever possible it should be cleansed of any company confidential information.</p>
				<p>We recommend that you discuss your work-term report with your coop employer during the second month of your work term. Since coop employers hire students from different programs, you may have to explain to them the E&CE work term report guidelines and marking procedures. This will avoid situations where your employer indicates at the last minute that the report can not go outside the company.  E&CE work term report markers will not sign a non-disclosure form related to your work term report or material contained in it. The only accommodation for a report marked confidential is the report will travel in an envelop marked confidential and only be read by one marker.</p>
				<p>In exceptional circumstances, you are allowed to submit at most one self-study work term report, out of the four required, as part of your undergraduate degree program.  A self-study report has all the same requirements as a regular work term report except for the Contributions section where you indicate it is not related to your coop work term job.</p>
				<p>Confidential reports can not be considered for awards or receive a grade of outstanding.</p>

			<h3 id = "employer">1.3 Employer Marked Work Reports</h3>
				<p>Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering work term reports are markedby the E&CE department. In exceptional cases, the E&CE departmentmay allow at most one of a student's four work term reports to be marked bysomeone outside of the department which the E&CE work term reportcoordinator has approved. This is a time consuming process and in manycases results in the report not being marked in time and the student beingassigned a failing grade for that work term report course.</p>
				<p>The process starts by the student contacting their undergrad program advisor (Electrical Engineering students contact Electrical Engineering Undergraduate Advisor <eeuga@ecemail.uwaterloo.ca>, while Computer Engineering students contact Computer Engineering Undergraduate Advisor <ceuga@ecemail.uwaterloo.ca> ) supplying the following marker information: company name, name, title, position within the company, contact information, PEO registration number, along with the name and contact information for their CECS field coordinator. The student will also supply their undergrad program advisor with: title of their report, date they submitted the work term report to their employer, number of pages in the report front matter, number of pages in the report body, number of pages in the report back matter. The student's program undergraduate advisor will contact the marker and CECS field coordinator to confirm the information. Once all the information has been confirmed, the student's program undergraduate advisor will supply it to the E&CE work term report coordinator for approval. If the marker is approved, then the student's program undergraduate advisor will supply the marker: the E&CE work term report guidelines, marking form, marking instructions, and a request that the marker inform us in writing on company letter head: the date they received your work term report, he/she marked it in accordance with the supplied instructions, title of the report, number of pages in the report front matter, number of pages in the report body, number of pages in the report back matter, their PEO registration number and signature. Once the marker has marked the report, they would forward the completed marking form to your program undergraduate advisor along with a signed statement (including PEO registration number) on company letter head that the report was marked according the specified guidelines.</p>
				<p>The student's program undergraduate advisor would keep a copy of: ( the email from the student, first memo to your marker, first memo from your marker, second memo to your marker, second memo from your marker, marking form ) in the student's undergraduate file prior to forwarding a copy of the marking form to CECS and the E&CE work term coordinator. The work term report mark would be folded in with the other work term report grades when the grades are submitted at the end of the term.</p>

			<h2>2. Report Structure and Format</h2>
			<h4>Three things go into a good work term (technical) report:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>structure and format</li>
					<li>technical communication skills</li>
					<li>technical/engineering analysis and content</li>
				</ol>
				<p>There are many valid technical report formats used across the industry. For uniformity across the reports marked by the <a href="http://www.ece.uwaterloo.ca">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>, students are to follow the structure and format specified in this guide.</p>
				<p>The report is made up of three parts: front matter, main body, back matter. The report is to use 11 point times-roman font for paragraph text with 1.5 line spacing in the report body. Single line spacing for front and back matter, except for Contributions and Summary sections which are 1.5 line spacing. Section headings are either 12 or 14 point times-roman bold font with 2 to 3 line spacing between sections. Each page should have a 1.5" left margin and 1" margins right,top,bottom with full justification paragraphs. The report body and appendices should use section numbers. The front matter is to be written for a nontechnical reader, with no section numbers or references cited in it. The Glossary and References are not to have section numbers. The report body (not including the one page Conclusions section and one page Recommendations section) should be 10 to 15 pages. Only reports using single sided printing will be accepted.</p>
			<h4>The <em>front matter</em> of the report should include the following in the specified order</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>Title Page</li>
   <li>Letter of Submittal</li>
   <li>Contributions</li>
   <li>Summary</li>
   <li>Table of Contents</li>
   <li>List of Figures</li>
   <li>List of Tables</li>
</ul>

      <div class ="structure float-container two-col align-center">
        <div class = "structure front-cover float-left">
          <h4>Front Cover</h4><br/>
          <img src = "front-cover.png"/>
        </div>

        <div class = "structure title-page float-left">
        <h4>Title Page</h4><br/>
        <img src = "title-page.png"/>

        <h4>Letter of Submittal</h4><br/>
        <img src = "letter-of-submittal.png"/>
      </div>
      <h4>It should be in standard business letter format and addressed to the E&CE chair.  It must contain the following</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>"confidential-1" if a confidential report</li>
        <li>"self-study" if a self-study report</li>
        <li>report title</li>

        <li>state who the report was written for</li>
        <li>declaration statement of the form <em>I hereby confirm that I have received no further help other than what is mentioned above in writing this report. I also confirm this report has not been previously submitted for academic credit at this or any other academic institution.</em></li>
        <li>student's name</li>

        <em>Contributions Section</em><br/>
        <img src = "contribution-section.png"/>
      </div>

      <h4>The following is a suggested format</h4>
      <p>It is a two to three page section written in first person which clearly identifies the student's contribution to the work. The primary purpose of this section is to permit the reader to evaluate the student's involvement in the work and the student's understanding of how their work relates to the team's goals. It is not the intent to mark the level of contribution. This section includes the following information:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The size of the team working on the entire project</li>
        <li>The team's main goal(s)</li>
        <li>Student's task(s)</li>
        <li>How the work term job relates to the work described in the work term report. (Note this does not preclude self study in exceptional circumstances.)</li>
        <li>How this work fits into the company's broader scheme of things.</li>
      </ol>



  <h4>Summary</h4>
  <p>It is an executive summary which communicates: the purpose and scope of the report, the major points in the report, highlights of the conclusions, and highlights of the recommendations.</p>
   <p>Keep in mind the front matter is to be written for a nontechnical reader. The following is a suggested format which normally results in wording for a nontechnical reader.</p>
    <dl>
     <dt>paragraph one</dt>
     <dd>
      The main purpose of the report is ... .
      <br>
      The scope of the report is ... .
     </dd>
     <dt>paragraph two</dt>
     <dd>The major points documented/covered in this report are ...</dd>
     <dt>paragraph three</dt>
     <dd>The major conclusions in this report are ...</dd>
     <dt>paragraph four</dt>
     <dd>The major recommendations in this report are ...</dd>
    </dl>
   </p>
  </dd>
  <div class = "structure table-of-contents align-center">
  <h4>Table of Contents</h4>
   <img src = "table-of-contents.png"/>
  </div>
  <p>It should appear on a separate page and contain entries for each report body section, subsection, ..., as well as, all the front matter and back matter (excluding the <em>Table of Contents</em> itself).</p>

  <h4>List of Figures</h4>
   <img src = "list-of-figures.png"/>

  <h4>List of Tables</h4>
   <img src = "list-of-tables.png"/>

<p>
 The front matter page numbers should be lower case roman numerals centered
 at the bottom of the page with the <em>title page</em> as page one.
 However, page numbers should not appear on either the <em>title page</em> or
 <em>letter of submittal</em>.  The page numbering should restart at start of
 report body and be arabic numbers.
</p>
<p>
 The <em>main body</em> of the report should clearly introduce and discuss
 the engineering analysis done, with conclusions drawn and recommendations
 made at the appropriate points in the report body.  The sectioning should
 effectively guide the reader through the report.  Complex details should be
 relegated to figures, tables, glossary, appendices, or cited references.
 Low-level explanations should be clear, concise, and direct.  Paragraph and
 sentence structures should be appropriate for a student in the specified
 academic term.  Standard techniques should be used to refer to mathematics,
 figures, tables, code fragments, appendices, glossaries, references, etc.
 All acronyms and jargon should be defined when they first appear in the
 report body and in the glossary.  Spelling and grammar should be correct,
 consistent, and appropriate for a student in the specified academic term.
 The report should be formatted in a consistent and visually pleasing way
 which adheres to these guidelines.  All material from other sources is
 properly cited.  There should be a minimum of three references cited (in
 IEEE format) in the report body with at least one of them a non-Internet
 source.  The body must include <em>Conclusions</em> and
 <em>Recommendations</em> sections at the end of it.
</p>
<p>
 The <em>Conclusions</em> section should clearly state what conclusions were
 drawn from the engineering analysis in the body of the report.  They should
 be short (half a page to one page long), to the point, and only state
 conclusions actually mentioned in the body of the report.
 <p>
 The following is a suggested opening phrase
 </p>
 <dl>
  <dd>From the analysis in the report body, it was concluded that ...</dd>
 </dl>
 followed by clear statements of the actual engineering conclusions and not a
 summary of the report.  This results in a Conclusions section which
 communicates the required information.
 <p>
 Conclusions should be brief, but complete and understandable.  You may use
 lists, but easy-to-read sentences are best.  Each paragraph should deal with
 only one aspect of the study.  Conclusions may only be drawn if they are
 supported fully by the analyses described in the body of your report or the
 references cited in the report body.  Three or more conclusions are
 expected.</p>
<p>
 The <em>Recommendations</em> section should clearly state what the
 recommendations (allocation of capital, human resources and/or future
 improvements) to your employer or management are to address the issues and
 conclusions in your report.
 <br>
 The following is a suggested opening phrase
 <dl>
  <dd>
   Based on the analysis and conclusions in this report, it is recommended
   that ...
  </dd>
 </dl>
 followed by clear statements of what actions you are recommending to
 management results in a Recommendations section which communicates the
 required information.
 <br>
 Two or more recommendations are expected.
</p>
<p>
  Proper technical writing practices are to be followed:
 <ul>
  <li>
   all figures have a number and title/caption below the figure,
  </li>
  <li>
   consistent figure numbering in the report body,
  </li>
  <li>
   all figures taken from another source, cite that source by reference
   number on the figure title line,
  </li>
  <li>
   all figures are cited (referred to by number) in the report body text
   before they appear in the report body,
  </li>
  <li>
   all tables have a number and title/caption above the table,
  </li>
  <li>
   consistent table numbering in the report body,
  </li>
  <li>
   all tables taken from another source, cite that source by reference
   number on the table title line,
  </li>
  <li>
   all tables are cited (referred to by number) in the report body text
   before they appear in the report body,
  </li>
  <li>
   all figures and tables are readable,
  </li>
  <li>
   all appendices are cited (referred to by number or letter) in the report
   body text,
  </li>
  <li>
   each reference (in the Reference section) is cited in the report body.
  </li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
 The <em>back matter</em> of the report must include a <em>References</em>
 section and optionally glossaries and/or appendices.
</p>
<p>
 The <em>References</em> section must contain at least three references, a
 minimum of one must be a non-Internet source.  Each reference must be
 referred to (cited) in the body of the report.  This list of references must
 be in the standard IEEE format (as described in [<a href="#IEEErefs">2</a>]
 or [<a href="#CompSoc">3</a>]) and include sufficient material for a reader
 to contact the publisher and obtain a copy of the referenced material.  In
 addition, it must clearly identify the source of all quotations,
 paraphrases, and technical data used in the report.  A report which fails to
 identify such sources shall be viewed as unacceptable and the student may be
 charged with plagiarism.  In short, anything that is not yours must be
 referenced.  References that are not accessible by the marker (such as
 <em>Personal Communications</em>, restricted access web sites, etc.) are not
 acceptable.  As an alternative, if a reference is not easily accessible by
 the marker, you may include a copy of it as an appendix, provided it is
 about 15 pages or less.  References must be ordered (numbered) in the
 sequence first cited in the report body.
</p>
<p>
 The <em>Glossary</em> section should define and explain all acronyms and
 special technical terms used in the report.  The <em>Glossary</em> section
 must come before the <em>References</em> section.
</p>
</section>

<section id = "communication">
<h2>3. Technical Communication</h2>

<h3>3.1 Structure and Flow</h3>
<p>
 The topic is clearly introduced and discussed, with conclusions drawn and
 recommendations made at the appropriate points in the report body.  The
 topic, major conclusions and recommendations are restated in the
 <em>Summary</em>, <em>Conclusions</em> and <em>Recommendations</em>
 sections.  Sectioning effectively guides the reader through the report.
 Complex details are relegated to figures, tables, glossaries, appendices, or
 cited references.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Detailed Presentation</h3>
<p>
 Low-level explanations are clear, concise, and direct.  Paragraph and
 sentence structures are appropriate to a university student at the specified
 level.  Standard techniques are used to refer to mathematics, figures,
 tables, code fragments, appendices, glossaries, references, etc.  Acronyms
 and jargon are defined.
</p>

<h3>3.3 Writing and Formatting</h3>
<p>
 Spelling and grammar are correct, consistent, and appropriate to a student
 in the specified academic term.  The report is formatted in a consistent and
 visually pleasing way which adheres to the E&CE guidelines.  Material
 from other sources is properly cited.
</p></section>

<section id = "content">
<h2>4. Technical Content</h2>
<p>
 The topic has sufficient scope and depth to justify a report.  The
 writing displays evidence of sound engineering judgement, analysis, and
 insight appropriate to a university student at the specified level.  The
 technical details appear to be correct, and form a coherent whole.
</p>
<p>
 If the report is on an engineering design, the customer requirements and
 design specifications are appendix material but may be summarized in the
 report body.  The body of the report should document the engineering
 process of transforming the customer requirements into the functional
 specifications followed by the engineering process to transform the
 functional specifications into the design specifications.  That is, the
 body of the report is on the engineering of the product/artifact not a
 marketing/product document of the finished product/artifact.
</p>
<p>
 It is expected that a report should include a clear definition of the
 problem at hand with the criteria for evaluating a possible solution.
 Quantitative criteria are preferred in engineering.  The report should
 also include the discussion and analysis of at least two possible
 solutions based on the criteria.  Conclusions and recommendations are
 made within the discussion and analysis.
</p>
<p>
 In general, a report with a comparison by itself is not acceptable.  A
 comparison may be acceptable if it is done as part of the student's own
 analysis of each possible solution.  Comparisons are generally not
 acceptable for third and fourth year reports.
</p>
<p>
 Remember to cite the source of all material used in your report not just
 things you quoted.  The introduction of your report should cite each of the
 references you used for background reading.  If you use a figure, diagram,
 data, or a table, even in modified form, you must cite the source of it.
 Failure to do so may result in a plagiarism case.
</p>
<p>
 Remember, a report content must not be related or similar to another
 document that you or somebody else received academic credit for.  This
 includes work term reports, fourth year design reports, or any other
 document.  Violation of this may result in a plagiarism case.
</p>
<p>
 If a report does not contain sufficient engineering analysis, it will be
 rejected with an unacceptable grade.  Remember, technical content and
 engineering analysis expectations increase with the level of the report.

<h2>Appendix A: Marking Form</h2>
<p>
 A work report examines a student's abilities to display sound engineering
 judgement on a topic of analysis or design and to produce a written report
 which is clear, concise, and convincing.  Constructive comments by
 evaluators are given to guide the student towards improved skills in
 communicating engineering ideas.
</p>
<p>
 The lower part of the E&CE work term report marking form contains 4
 sets of radio buttons of the form: <em>yes</em>, <em>mostly</em>,
 <em>marginally</em>, <em>slightly</em>, <em>no</em>.  One set for each of:

   How to tell if a report topic will be acceptable
  </a>
 </strong></dt>
 <dd>
  Write the <em>purpose and scope</em> sentence/paragraph for your report's
  Introduction and Summary sections.  If it implies a set of conclusions
  which imply a set of recommendations, that will communicate the
  expected/required level of engineering analysis, insight, and judgement,
  then you are fine.  If it does not, then you need a new topic.  In most
  cases, you want to approach the report as if you are a consulting engineer
  who has been retained by a client to investigate some issue/problem and
  supply a set of engineering recommendations to resolve that issue/problem
  for the client.

  <a name="FAQ_06">
   References are only for exact quotes and imported data or figures?
  </a>
 </strong></dt>
 <dd>
  No.  References are much more than that.  In fact, in technical reports,
  a reference is rarely for a direct quote.  A reference is normally used
  to indicate where a given piece of IP (intellectual property) came from
  or where a reader might find additional information on a given topic.
  That is, a reference says, this idea or data came from that source, or
  refer to that reference for additional information on this subject.

   How many figures/tables are consider too many/few?

 <dd>
  There is no exact number for this as it is context dependent on the
  engineering material presented in the report body.  However, zero tables
  or figures normally indicates insufficient engineering analysis, insight,
  and judgement.  You need sufficient tables and/or figures to support the
  engineering analysis and the flow of the report body text.  If there are
  too many tables and/or figures, which are not key to understanding what
  the report body is saying, then these extra figures and/or tables should
  be placed in an appendix.

   How are late work term reports handled?
  </a>
 </strong></dt>
 <dd>
  See <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/default.aspx?pageID=173">
  E&P rule 17</a>.
  If a work term report is received after the due date, it will be assigned
  a grade of <em>38</em> for the current term.  There are two cases:
  <ol>
   <li>
    This occurred prior to fall 2009 term.
    <br>
    The late report will be marked as a <em>supplemental exam</em> in the
    following term.  This does not impact your term average, but does
    increase your cumulative failed course count by one and results in a
    <em>CNDF</em> (Conditional Promotion) assuming you have a 60% or better
    average and no more than two failed courses in that term.  If the
    cumulative failed course count exceeds two, your academic decision
    changes to MNP (May Not Proceed) per
    <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/default.aspx?pageID=173">E&P
    rule 7</a> and you are stopped until it is reduced to less than 2.
    <br>
    Keep in mind the <em>38</em> remains on your transcript.  When the course
    is cleared a <em>Supp Satisfied</em> appears beside the original grade
    indicating the failure has been cleared.  When all the failed courses in
    that term are cleared, the academic decision will change to <em>PROG</em>
    (Promotion Granted) independent of the term average.  As such, if you fail
    a work term report, the grade of 38 appears/stays on your transcript and
    your academic decision can be no better than <em>PROG</em>.
   </li>
   <li>
    This occurred after the spring 2009 term.
    <br>
    You must enroll in the wkrpt course in some future term when the report
    will be marked and the grade recorded.  Keep in mind the report must be
    cleared prior to a specified term (see <a href="#FAQ_09">Can I submit a

  <a name="FAQ_11">
   What goes in the contribution section for a self-study work term report?
  </a>
 </strong></dt>
 <dd>
  A self-study work term report is like a regular work term report except
  for:
  <ol>
   <li>
    In the <em>Letter of Submittal</em> you need to clearly state it is a
    self-study work term report.  The letter needs to address all the
    other points mentioned in the report
    <a href="#Report_Structure">Structure and Format</a>
    section.
   </li>
   <li>
    In the <em>Contribution Section</em>, where it discusses
    <em>relationship between report and student's job</em>, you clearly
    state there is no relationship, as it is a self-study work term
    report.  As above, the contribution section needs to address all
    the other points mentioned in the report
    <a href="#Report_Structure">Structure and Format</a>
    section.
   </li>
  </ol>
  Keep in mind, a self-study work term report is always associated
  with an actual coop work term and coop employer.  This is always
  possible for your second, third, and fourth work term reports as
  you have six work terms but there are only four required work
  term reports.  You have a work term report due after your first,
  third, fourth, and fifth work terms.  The only exception to this
  requirement is covered in
  <a href="#FAQ_25"><em>What if I do not get a coop job for my first work term</em></a>.

  a technical person or business person, when reading the front matter of the
  report, what the report is about, what was concluded, and what is being
  recommended to management.  Keep in mind the <em>it was concluded</em>
  phrase is a much stronger/clearer phrase than the <em>proved to be</em>
  phrase and the <em>it is recommended</em> phrase is a much stronger phrase
  than the <em>it is suggested</em> phrase.  As such, you should use the

  No.  A reading of the various declaration statements for the Fourth Year
  Design Project reports and the declaration statement for the work term
  report make it clear you can not submit reports for academic credit in
  two courses for the same work.  As such, careful separation of the two

 <dd>
  If you end up exercising your option to write one self study work term
  report as part of your BASc CompEng/ElecEng degree program, you pick a
  topic area you would like to research, do the research and write an
  engineering analysis centric report.  The easiest way is to assume you
  are a consultant retained by a client to investigate a solution to some
  problem they have.  In the process of doing your engineering analysis you
  will investigate two or more possible solutions and develop some measure
  of <em>goodness</em> which you will apply to each potential solution.
  The <em>goodness</em> numbers coming from these <em>goodness</em>
  measurements will point to a set of engineering conclusions.  Given these
  engineering conclusions and your client's business setup, you will come
  up with some engineering recommendations for your client.

  <ol>
   <li>
    Log into the
    <a href="https://ecewo.uwaterloo.ca">Work Reports Online</a>
    application and select <em>E&CE Work Term Reports Online</em>.  It
    will prompt you for your userid, which is the same as your nexus
    userid, and password, which is your studentid, if you have not changed
    it.  <strong>It is highly recommended that once you log in the first
    time, change your password from the default password</strong>.  Now
    select <em>Your Info</em> and the application will supply you the status
    on your reports.  Once a report has been marked the marker's name and the
    various dates will appear.  Note, if you click in the triangle in any of
    the <em>Work Reports</em> or <em>Mark Form Status</em> column headers,
    the application will sort the rows according to that column.

   <li>
    The <em>Work Reports Online</em> database application sends email when
    specific database transactions happen.  You may expect your report to
    have its marking completed in about five weeks from the date of the email
    informing you that your report is assigned to a marker.  However, since
